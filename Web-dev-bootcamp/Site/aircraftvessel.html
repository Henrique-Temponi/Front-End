            An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying,
            arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, 
            as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. 
            Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships 
            that carry numerous fighters, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. While heavier aircraft such as fixed-wing gunships 
            and bombers have been <span class="intext">launched from aircraft carriers, it is currently not possible to land them. By its diplomatic and tactical power,</span> 
            its mobility, its autonomy and the variety of its means, the aircraft carrier is often the centerpiece of modern combat fleets. 
            Tactically or even strategically, it replaced the battleship in the role of flagship of a fleet. One of its great advantages is that, 
            by sailing in international waters, it does not interfere with any territorial sovereignty and thus obviates the need for overflight 
            authorizations from third-party countries, reduces the times and transit distances of aircraft and therefore significantly increase the 
            time of availability on the combat zone.
