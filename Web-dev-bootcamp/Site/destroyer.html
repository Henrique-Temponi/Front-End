        In naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, 
        convoy or battle group and defend them against powerful short range attackers. They were originally developed in the late 19th 
        century by Fernando Villaamil for the Spanish Navy as a defense against torpedo boats, and by the time of the 
        Russo-Japanese War in 1904, these "torpedo boat destroyers" (TBDs) were "large, swift, and powerfully armed torpedo boats 
        designed to destroy other torpedo boats"

        Although the term "destroyer" had been used interchangeably with "TBD" and "torpedo boat destroyer" by navies since 1892, 
        the term "torpedo boat destroyer" had been generally shortened to simply "destroyer" by nearly all navies by the First World War.
